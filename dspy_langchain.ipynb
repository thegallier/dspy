To a grownup, this movie is moronic and boring.The only good part of the movie is the very end when we see the birth of Princess Leia and her twin brother Luke Skywalker, and they are placed in foster homes because their mom is dead and their dad is the enemy.  The babies are cute, and you really can't lose by showing newborn babies.Aside from that, this movie is horrible.  The fight scenes are worse than kung fu flicks with idiots hopping around like bunnies.  The acting, particularly that of Anakin Skywalker, is really juvenile and pathetic.  The writing is worst of all.  The writing really deserves to be punished.  The screenwriter deserves a good whipping for this garbage.Anakin and Obiwan Kenobi are in another stupid fight, when suddenly Obiwan lands on higher ground and tells Anakin to give it up because it is hopeless since he is on higher ground.  Hahahaha.  What idiot thought of that?  They just needed an excuse to have Obiwan win the fight, so they made up that nonsense.  Does the public really buy that?  How many times in this same movie do people jump around from lower to higher ground and vice versa?  Oh my god is this a STUPID film.I knew it was going to be utterly stupid very early on, when the two jedi were about to enter an air battle in their planes, and one of them put a smile on his face and said This is where the fun starts.  In other words, as we well know, there is absolutely no doubt who will win, because at this stage of the movie the good guys win, and there isn't even any tension in a battle, it's just a ballgame.  Remove all realism from the script, why don't you.Another utterly stupid bit of writing, considering that this silly flick is targeted for children, is to have the only female in the cast die in childbirth.  Great.  Take your young daughters to see it.  They will have this to identify with and remember the rest of their lives.  When your target audience is young children, as the target is for this film because anyone who is not a baby will see how moronic it is, why do you want to scare the Bejesus out of the little girls in the theatre regarding having children of their own?It's a shame that instead of being punished for this garbage, the people responsible for this movie actually got paid for it.

This is how the story goes: Senior Charley Brewster finally has it all -- he's running with the popular crowd and dating the hottest girl in high school. In fact, he's so cool he's even dissing his best friend Ed. But trouble arrives when an intriguing stranger Jerry moves in next door. He seems like a great guy at first, but there's something not quite right -- and everyone, including Charley's mom, doesn't notice. After witnessing some very unusual activity, Charley comes to an unmistakable conclusion: Jerry is a vampire preying on his neighborhood. Unable to convince anyone that he's telling the truth, Charley has to find a way to get rid of the monster himself.The cast led by Anton Yelchin (as Charley Brewster) & Colin Farrell (as Jerry) is great. The directing by Craig Gillespie is great. The story by Tom Holland (based on his original 1985 \"Fright Night\") & the screenplay by Marti Noxon is great.The music by Ramin Djawadi is great. The cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe is great. The film editing by Tatiana S. Riegel is great. The casting by Allison Jones is great. The production design by Richard Bridgland is great.

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's (young and adult alike) every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.In short, 13 Going on 30 is a movie definitely worth watching!

            "Retrieved Contexts: To let the truth be known, I watched this movie with a mix of anticipation and fear. Being an avid Star Wars fan, I was excited to see any Star Wars movie, but I suspected this would be as disappointing as the Phantom Menace. WRONG! Although this doesn't even come close to the great casting and story lines and sheer art of the first three Star Wars series, it was WAY better than Phantom Menace for the following reasons: 1) This movie included LESS Jar-Jar, which, despite initial heavy marketing for the first movie, the character was found by the general consensus to be REALLY annoying. 2) This movie demonstrated some of the political turmoil behind the original Star Wars movies. 3) You get to see some of what led Anakin to turn over to the Dark Side. Finally, the special effects were really good!It was not 4 or 5 stars because the actors that were cast in this movie (as well as The Phantom Menace) are all well known for other cinematic accomplishments, and it was hard to believe that they were supposed to be these other characters.  They should have casted lesser-known actors, in my opinion.  Also, the plot about the clones was weak, to me.But, note well- the fight-scene with Yoda by itself makes the movie worth watching. It was action packed, entertaining, and even a little bit funny.  I do recommend this movie to any Star Wars fan, way way better than the Phantom Menace, but do not go into it expecting it to be as good as the first Star Wars series. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n"
